# Software-in-class-testing

Task 2
PyTest is another unit test framework that is a third party alternative to the unit testing framework.
It has the user define the tests in their own functions to then be run. The idea is that since you 
have to define the testing functions yourselves instead of using something such as “assertEqual” it gives the user more 
flexibility in their tests.  This framework will also list out how many tests passed, instead of how many failed.
